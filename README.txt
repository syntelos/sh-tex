Archive

  The 'archive' tool is an independent conglomeration of the toolbox
  concept into a related artefact.  In this case, the toolbox produces
  /home/usr/Pictures/archive from Screenshot files in
  /home/usr/Pictures, and encodes daily MPEG-4 summations from an
  index.  It also maintains a labels list.

  The 'archive' tool enables workspace recording and sharing.  This is
  useful for work effort visualization, work technique illustration,
  work flow presentation, and other information - experiential
  recording from the workstation.
